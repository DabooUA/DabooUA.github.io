I'm very new to concept of Blogging. So here it goes.

After spending few months learning from Intro to Ruby to Procedural Ruby and Object-Oriented Ruby which have taken me few months because I do have a newborn, toddler and work full time. Well, also letâ€™s not forget the fact that it has been and continue to be a very rough year for all of us, as COVID-19 continue to wreak havoc on all of our lives.
When I stared on CLI project I was little bit lost as to where I need to start first. After spending a frustrating week and half figuring out issue with Learn IDE, I had to install local environment. After that I have spent almost 2 weeks trying to pick the Website I can use for the project. Considering how short the and mostly code alone Section 15 - Scrapping was, it was hard to select the right website to Scrape. In two case I had selected wrong websites as one of them used to much JavaScript while other one no longer had private API key for public/online events.
Finally, I have decided to with website that is some what become more relevant than ever before after becoming a father. And as soon as my daughter got old enough and start watching movies, Disney Plus have become our favorite app on our TV. I guess my daughter have contributed to my project.
After I had Scrapable website, I spent some more time trying to figure out how I will Scrape the information from website and how I will use it by implementing some logic for any user that will us it. I have hit the wall with my code several times. But after spending some time on Google.com and researching different concepts and watching some videos I was able to resolve the issues with the code that I have. Also, I have found myself using pinding.pry and IRB more than I ever used before through the course so far and planning on using it as it does saves time.
The one thing I can take away from my first project is that you should never gave up, but also do not push yourself to the limit on the days that you feel drained physically and emotionally.
While the project itself is built to run in terminal I could not resist to add some style to it and just little bit color. 
	After completing my first project I do feel more confident in anu future projects that await me in next few weeks and months.
